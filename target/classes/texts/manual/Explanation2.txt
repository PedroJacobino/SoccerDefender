Waves

Each Wave will have an incremented level
of players in it, first all level 0 
players from France, then Germany, then
Holland will traverse the map, then 
all level 1 or less from them and so on.
There is 5 seconds between each WaveEvent
so you can have time for putting back 
Towers which died.
Every time a wave finishes you get a new
set of players you can use, there is no
limit for Towers in the Map.
After every WaveEvent all your Towers are
regenerated and if they died you will be 
able to use them again, unless they are 
Goalkeepers.
